<h1>Simple-Textutils-Project</h1>

In this project, we can convert text to uppercase, lowercase, copytext or extraspaces remove, clear text, and enable dark or light mode. My web app also displays the total words and characters, as well as the time to read. In creating it, I have used React's useState, props, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
